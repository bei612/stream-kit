# Stream-Kit service deployment

The Linux unit runs the pinned Orchestrator binary with a dedicated service account and persistent state directories. Install it under `/opt/stream-kit`, copy the unit to `/etc/systemd/system`, create `/etc/stream-kit/orchestrator.json`, then run `systemctl enable --now stream-kit-orchestrator`.

On Windows, run `install-windows-service.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell after placing `orchestrator.exe` in the install root. The service is configured for automatic restart by the Windows Service Control Manager.

TLS termination should be provided by the deployment ingress; the Orchestrator bind address must remain private when TLS is terminated outside the process.
